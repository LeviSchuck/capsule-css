# Capsule

A mish-mash of SASS/SCSS framework components from places such as 

* MIT licensed Foundation 4
* My own (consider under MIT)

In the future, perhaps other things either directly or modeled after

* MIT / CC-BY 3.0 licensed Flat-UI
* MIT licensed [Retina Sprites For Compass](https://github.com/Gaya/Retina-Sprites-for-Compass/issues/3)
* Apache 2.0 Licensed Twitter Bootstrap components
